    <p>The doctorate in  Clinical Psychology is designed to provide high   quality post-graduate  professional training in Clinical Psychology   leading to the award of a doctoral  qualification. The course is   designed to produce clinical psychologists who are  equipped with the   skills to respond flexibly to the changing demands of the  Irish health   and related services. A core value in the course is the emphasis  on   linking theory and practice, informed by the reflective scientist    practitioner philosophy of integrated training in research methods,   academic  knowledge and clinical experience. Course Content and Structure. The course comprises  three major components: (i) research training,   (ii) academic training and (iii)  clinical placements.&nbsp; Students   currently spend approximately 55% of course  time on clinical placement.   The remainder is divided between the taught  academic programme and   research activity.&nbsp; There will also be block  teaching modules   throughout the three years of training. Assessment Candidates are  assessed throughout the course by (i) examinations,   (ii) coursework (including  reports of clinical activity), (iii) written   submissions based on oral  presentations (iv) a dissertation and (v)   evaluations of clinical competence.  All candidates are required to   attend a viva-voce examination. Assessment is  based on the evaluation   of performance on eight taught academic modules, six clinical    placements, four reports of clinical activity, a small-scale research   project  and a dissertation. All of these assessed elements of the   course must be passed  to successfully complete the programme. Placements The aim of  clinical placements is to ensure that trainees develop   core skills through  experiences with different client groups. In   addition, trainees will apply a  variety of psychological models to a   wide range of clinical problems and  clients across the age spectrum,   and in a variety of settings. Core placements  involve direct assessment   and intervention work with clients and triadic work  with carers and   others. The Course allocates 55% of total available Course time  to   clinical experience. Each of the six placements extends across a period   of  five months, in order to allow the trainees adequate time to develop   their  skills in assessment, formulation, intervention, evaluation and   reporting. A developmental  model of placement sequencing has been developed by   the Course, which is  regularly reviewed. This provides students with   the opportunity to develop  their clinical experience in a planned   manner. Currently, the first year  trainees commence their training with   a four week block induction programme  which addresses the practical   issues pertaining to child and adult work.  &nbsp;Following their induction   programme, trainees commence a five month  placement in either a child   or an adult mental health service and then move in  sequence to either   child or adult then a learning disability placement. Elective  placements mark an important progression in the student’s   development in terms  of developing and consolidating areas of special   interest.&nbsp; In addition,  they serve to focus the student’s preparation   for work beyond the Course. The  Course has developed placements in a   wide range of specialist services across  the Dublin  region. Specialist   experience consolidates and develops the student’s existing  expertise   and allows for special interests. On this Course, a placement could  be   specialist with respect of client group; setting; or therapeutic    orientation. Partnership The course is run  by a core team of seven academic and two   administrative staff, four of whom are  employed by Trinity   College   and five by the  Health Service Executive. All academic staff have an   ongoing commitment to  clinical work within the HSE, Eastern Region. The   course Steering Committee has  representatives from all the major   stakeholders. Course team members attend HSE  psychology meetings and   HSE and voluntary sector clinical psychologists are  heavily involved in   course development and delivery. Placements are drawn from  the HSE   region and from the voluntary sector. These arrangements help to foster    an excellent spirit of collaboration between the course and its   sponsors.High  quality training in clinical psychology Integration  of theory and practice Development  of a reflective scientist practitioner philosophy Flexible  routes through training Partnership  with sponsors Facilitation  of specialised interests Exposure to  a wide range of theoretical models and therapeutic   approaches Entry Requirements Applicants will  be formally required to hold at least an upper   second class honours primary  degree in Psychology from a recognised   University Course, which confers  eligibility for graduate registration   with the Psychological Society of  Ireland. A candidate’s demonstrated   interest in the field of clinical  psychology and research competence   will also be taken into account.
