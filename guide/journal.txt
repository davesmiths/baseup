Interface thoughts:

Breakpoint 0
    At 0
    Columns 4
Breakpoint 1
    At 768
    Columns 16
Add breakpoint

Rapid on
    Position classes on

Advanced
    Decimal places
    
Widths given at breakpoint 0 are just w1o3 etc. compared to breakpoint1 w1o3-b1

Realised that there are functions dependent on the app and utility functions.
And that the beauty of a function is that the dependencies are delivered via the arguments array.

So, was thinking that instead of all this classes, prototyping malarkey that requires understanding of what "this" is 
at any point, I'd just pass an object with everything in it and forget "this"

IE 6 and 7 bug

asd
<div class="col">
  <div class="col w2o3">
    <div class="gut" style="background:#dee;">Content
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col w1o3">
    <div class="gut" style="background:#ede;">Sidebar
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
asd

Even though the outer .col is floated and therefore contains all floats.
IE6 and 7 display asdasd next to each other before the layout, seemingly
like the outer .col is not clearing floats.
This is fixed by wrapping the second "asd" in a block level element. An inline element will not do

I want to add a class to add a marginbottom equal to the line-height, probably should go on .col

Writing up the problem with layout gutters floats with IE6.
The problem is
<div class="layout-gutter">
    <div class="layout w2o3">
        <div class="column gutter">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="layout w1o3">
        <div class="column gutter">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

where
    layout gutter has a negative margin-left of 50px and haslayout
    gutter is margin-left:50px
    p1o3 is margin-left:0;
    p2o3 is margin-left:33.3333%

result
    a gap to the right of the layout or the layout gets a bit strange

solved with
<div class="layout-gutter">
    <div class="ie6fix">
        <div class="layout w2o3">
            <div class="column gutter">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="layout w1o3">
            <div class="column gutter">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

where ie6fix is just set to haslayout with display:inline-blocks

Writing up problem with clearing layout that are positional
<div class="layout pos1">
    <div class="column style-colour1">1 </div>
</div>
<div class="layout pos2">
    <div class="column style-colour2">2 </div>
</div>
<div class="layout pos3">
    <div class="column style-colour3">3 </div>
</div>
<div class="layout-clear"></div>
<div class="layout pos1">
    <div class="column style-colour1">4 </div>
</div>
<div class="layout pos2">
    <div class="column style-colour2">5 </div>
</div>
<div class="layout pos3">
    <div class="column style-colour3">6 </div>
</div>
<div class="layout-clear"></div>

where pos1 pos2 pos3 have margin-right:-100% and a margin-left to position them wherever

Problem is the clear fails and 4,5,6 overlay 1,2,3.

Solved by <del>using margin-right:99%, but does affect positioning</del> do something else.

Solved by making sure the div.layout-clear is no hasLayout, giving it two children divs. The first
float left width 100% and the second clear both. The full solution is here:
<div class="layout-clear">
    <div class="layout-ie6fix2"></div>
    <div class="layout-ie6fix3"></div>
</div>
.layout-clear {clear:both;}
.layout-ie6fix2 {float:left;width:100%;height:0;overflow:hidden;}
.layout-ie6fix3 {clear:both;height:0;overflow:hidden;}

There is a repaint issue in IE7 when using positional floats. However, there is hope as 
after using the element inspector in the dev toolbar the repaint bug disappears.

IE7 repaint bug raises its ugly head when using positional floats and an ancestor element
has a background colour applied. It is solved by making that ancester hasLayout. So position:relative, 
zoom:1 have worked so far.

Found IE7 .column text-indent bug. If a .column has text-indent and it is the last in a layout column
then the page can overflow by the textindent amount. Doesn't affect any other versions of IE.
Solved by adding overflow:hidden to .column or .layout as IE6 requires overflow hidden for .layout anyway
